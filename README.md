# Pokedex v2

## Task Completion History

### January 5, 2024

- Added foundational HTML and styling
- Added function that retrieves Pokémon data from API based on specified offset and limit for pagination reasons

Restarting a [not-too-long-ago project](https://github.com/marielle-lopez/pokedex) from scratch, which had the purpose of being a Pokédex that utilised the free [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). I currently do not have a complete set of features to implement in mind, except the product to at least be able to search for any Pokémon. So, this will be my first big goal!
